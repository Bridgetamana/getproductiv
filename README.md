# Getproductiv

A minimalist productivity app that helps you focus on one task at a time.

## What it does

Add your tasks, and Getproductiv shows you only **one task at a time**. Complete it, and the next one appears. No overwhelming lists—just focused work.

## Features

- **Single-task focus** — See only your current task, the rest wait in the queue
- **Task queue** — View and manage upcoming tasks in the sidebar
- **Delete tasks** — Remove any queued task you no longer need
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Work faster without touching your mouse
- **Mini window (PiP)** — Pop out your current task to a floating window (desktop Chrome)
- **PWA** — Install on mobile or desktop
